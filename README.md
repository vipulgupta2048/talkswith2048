> This repository acts as a showcase of just about ... everything I have done since I got introduced to tech back in 2016. It's an odometer that keeps track of my professional journey for I think was time well spent on Earth giving back. Personal introspection aside, maintaing this collection has worked well for sudden bouts of either imposter syndrome hitting or recruiter screens when looking for a role. 

Welcome to my corner of the internet!
 
I am Vipul Gupta (@vipulgupta2048). I am an open-source developer, documentarian, community manager and growth hacker. I enjoy backpacking solo on long trips, reviewing cheesecakes in each country I visit and collecting Calvin & Hobbes comics. Current, I am a product owner and documentation lead at Balena building open-source hardtech products. I also run a initiative to "right" the docs for startups and organizations called Mixster. 

I strongly believe in Open source is more than software. It’s a culture, a conversation, a way to bring the best minds together for the common good. This culture thrives on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and shared achievement. It's a realm where barriers of entry have been lowered to enable folks to grow, contribute and learn from each other. As a result, open-source is not just a method for developing software; it's a movement; it's a way of life. I aim to rethink that for more companies embracing [innersource](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-innersource/) and want to take on new roles in organization to do just that. Refer to [hiring me](#hire-2048) section.

Over the years, I have given back my time/money/efforts in enabling communities, conferences, meetups, projects and people towards a better open-source future. Free to reuse this template as a base to map your own journey.

## Talks with 2048

From local meetups to global conferences, I've aimed to weave technical concepts into unconventional, witty narratives. I believe deeply in the impact of a good story. Through my talks, I strive to not just inform but to connect, making each concept relatable and each session memorable. I still have a lot to learn, and you can find me collecting feedback from the audience after the talk. I intend to bring my unqiue brand of fun into each session I propose. No repeats, no boring monologue, if I can help it - Just a good, fun story. Served on a stage near you. Next time, please pull me in for feedback that you can provide.

The talks was a deep dive into the last three years of my work at balena building an open-source hardware-in-the-loop pipeline that tests software directly on an IoT device in a CI/CD pipeline. The work resulted in balenaOS being released in a matter of hours rather than weeks of testing. Further blogs on the topic [1](https://blog.balena.io/from-pr-to-release-os-testing-at-balena/) [2](https://blog.balena.io/maximizing-resources-in-the-chip-shortage-how-balenaos-testing-went-virtual/) |

## Conferences with 2048

From attending, to volunteering, to organizing and networking in conferences. Whatever role I play in a conference. I add it here. Conferences are strange for me in their phenomena. Apart from all the travel, meeting people, preparing to take the stage there is a genuine fear of missing out for me. If I don't attend one, there is FOMO. But, the more you connect in one, the more FOMO you get. Whether that's the case for you. Few things are certain. Social batteries are bound to run out. Leg pain is mandatory. And, If you are attending every single session then probably rethink your approach and spend some time in the hallway. See you there!

From the start, I had the pleasure of contributing and participating in Google Summer of Code with [Sugar Labs in 2018](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc) and again a year later with [The Scrapy Project in 2019](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc). Executing these projects and working with the organizations taught me a lot. Even after the projects have finished, I continued to volunteer with Sugar Labs focusing on Outreach efforts and playing an active part in their Google OSS programs. I contribute code frequently to ScrapingHub and The Scrapy Project. These were good times indeed.

## Mentoring with 2048

| Program  | Organization | Status/LoC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mentoring contributors at my Alma Mater | [ALiAS](https://asetalias.in) | My proudest achievement has been founding an independent, open-source college community with my peers. Few students in a classroom peer learning git and GitHub kickstarted the open-source culture at my Alma mater that grew into hundreds of students across campuses learning to contribute to FOSS. The community decayed at one point but never died. It's flourishing with folks self-organizing internships, summer of code programs, hackathons and conferences. It's free, open for all and has no hierarchal governance model. Student volunteers run events every week with support from seniors (us) who provide mentorship, opportunities and guidance that we never received. I started the [ALiAS AMA](https://mixster.dev/2019/06/01/aliasama/), and [Abroad Opportunities Fund Scholarship](https://amity.edu/admissions-scholarship.aspx) to help students get access to every opportunity they want to reach out for.  |

I participated mentoring students to accomplish a total of 178 tasks alloted by the organization. | 
| [OpenEBS Hackfest](https://mixster.dev/2018/05/26/writing-documentation-hacking-with-go-for-openebs-foss/) | OpenEBS | OpenEBS Hackfest is a 3-month long open-source contribution festival.

## Projects with 2048

Who knew? I love working on product design so much. It all started with this take-home assignment, I received from a PM interview. Now, I work on product design creating wireframes on AdobeXD whenever I feel like it. It feels liberating to let my ideas flow on a 770x340Px artboard with nothing but me and my prototypes.

| Products  | Project Link | Comments |
| --- |:---:|---|
|![](./docs/img/mockup/bookhustler.png)| [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/86486979/The-BookHustler-Project) | The BookHustler Project was my first project. It's an e-commerce app for buying, selling, and renting second-hand books online. I have [documented the idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ppgt6Pk2n0Mdp2YpBTtIym8Nx4ugAlAz92r067DDsEU/edit?usp=sharing) as well behind the project if you like to read. It has all the information from the logistics of how books are bought and sold to the renting model involved.

## Organizing with 2048

After being an organizer for many years to a number of communities, I have thought of starting my own meetups. I take huge pride in striking that spark that is conversations between strangers, building relationships more than piling up connections and helping my people succeed. Good vibes guaranteed is what I bring to a conference/meetup. Here's what I have worked on in the past.

| Meetups/Conferences | Link | Years  | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Github GitTogether Meetups | [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gittogether-delhi/?eventOrigin=event_home_page) | 2024 - present  | Organizer for GitTogether Delhi NCR is a gathering for developers in and around Delhi, India.

| RemoteIndian Delhi Meetup | [Meetup](https://lu.ma/delhiremote) | 2022 - present  | I organize mini meetups with folks in and around the city who like to come out and meet people on Saturday. |
| PyDelhi Meetup | [Meetup](https://meetup.com/pydelhi) | 2017-2020 | Actively volunteered as co-organizer for 3 years till Covid came and my social battery got depleted through Zoom meetups. During my time, we organized meetups every fortnight for 2 years straight with several collaborations, workshops, talks, devsprints and fun hackathons in the middle. The community grew to 11k members but don't have the bandwidth remaining to be co-organizer again. |
| Indian Linux users Group Delhi meetup | [Meetup](https://meetup.com/ilugdelhi) | 2017-2020 | Volunteered for the meetups for a couple of years. |

## Credits

I always had an idea to build a docs as portfolio website since I love docs so much but the inspiration on Docusaurus showcase definitely helped. That's where I found [kosiec.dev](https://kosiec.dev/)'s clean, minimalistic site welcome page which I really liked.
