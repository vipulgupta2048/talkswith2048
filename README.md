# Talks with 2048

[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048) [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

This repository acts as a showcase... of everything I loved doing in my college years (Thankfully, i am not done yet). It's a gauge I keep for my progress, as well how I far I have come. It's also a showcase that I keep linked to my portfolio. So you might be here, because of that as well.

This repository acts as a reference and backup of all resources and material used in my talks or workshops conducted. I just love to give back to the community in whatever way I can, hence kept everything completely open-source and public for anyone to use in whatever capacity they see fit.

Adding on to it, this repository is also a tracker of conferences that I attended/invited/volunteered for. From 2018 I have added a new section for hackathons that I am selected/invited to attend and participate along-with specific project details. 

At last, I am thankful for everyone with the opportunity and the motivation that I have gotten over the years to keep this up. I hope this information is useful and inspiring, for people looking to contribute and expose themselves for everything that is out there and make the most of it.
