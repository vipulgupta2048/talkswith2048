## About 2048

_This repository acts as a showcase... of just about everything I enjoyed doing in my college years and kept doing (Thankfully, I ~ain't~ am done, no thanks to 2020) It's a personal gauge I keep for progress, personal development and most importantly to remind me of impact I have on people around me, while my time on Earth. To be frank, I visit this corner of the web when the imposter syndrome hits.._

I genuinely love giving back to the open-source community in whatever way I can. Each figment of contribution had a purpose and therefore all talk resources, slides, designs and code whatever I have created is open-source and free for anyone to use/view/modify in whatever capacity they see fit unless stated otherwise. If you are unsure about something, drop me a message. Adding on to it, this repository is also a tracker of conferences that I attended/was invited/volunteered for. Networking and listening to people has always been the one activity that fuels my enthusiasm. Maybe that's my DevRel side speaking right now. Who knows?

> ### because for some, maybe the sky is the limit, for others, it's just the starting point.

This repository has gone through a lot of updates. [Check them out at the end](#updates).

# Best Blogs on Mixster by 2048 (Top 10 all-time)
I always wanted to do this. Coming soon.
I instead released a newsletter, [Mixster x Mixtapes](https://buttondown.email/vipulgupta2048)

# Google Summer of Code with 2048
In my college years, I had the pleasure of contributing and participating in [Google Summer of Code 2018 with Sugar Labs](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc) and with [The Scrapy Project in 2019](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc). These projects have taught, helped make me who I am. Even after the projects have finished, I still continue to volunteer with Sugar Labs focusing on Outreach efforts and playing an active part in their Google OSS programs. I contribute code frequently to ScrapingHub and The Scrapy Project. These were good times indeed.

## Products by 2048

Who knew? I love working on product design so much. It all started with this take-home assignment, I received from a PM interview. Now, I work on product design creating wireframes on AdobeXD whenever I feel like it. It feels liberating to let my ideas flow on a 770x340Px artboard with nothing but me and my prototypes.

| Products  | Project Link | Comments |
| --- |:---:|---|
|![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22801822/66336903-a4576f00-e95b-11e9-82ff-a64c8f30954c.png)| [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/86486979/The-BookHustler-Project) | The BookHustler Project was my first project. It's an e-commerce app for buying, selling, and renting second-hand books online. I have [documented the idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ppgt6Pk2n0Mdp2YpBTtIym8Nx4ugAlAz92r067DDsEU/edit?usp=sharing) as well behind the project if you like to read. It has all the information from the logistics of how books are bought and sold to the renting model involved.

## Failures of 2048
Unfortunately, that list will take way too long to compile. You would have better chances of escaping the gravitational pull of a small black hole than getting that list. What I mean by that for people reading this is, I could have achieved nothing of this sort without failing a thousand times first, and then getting up just to fail again. You (The Reader) my advice for you is to dig deep, don't lose hope, and give your best shot to everything from this moment on. Life's got something nice in store for all of you. Trust me and if you think you are mediocre.

Then, `fuck` `mediocrity`

## Updates

**#1** - From 2018, I added a new section for hackathons. I think hackathons are a great way to learn fast, implement faster, and learn from mistakes of the past. An ideology that I thoroughly believe to practice in my day-to-day.

**#2** - From 2019, added Podcasts as well :hatching_chick:

**#3** - From July'19, I am adding posters as well. Something I like dearly is creating good content, no matter how hard it might be. Meetup posters hold quite a special place in my mind as that always helps me think towards design, UI/UX as well as mixing up different techniques. These are Canva made, ain't special. I like them so why not show them.

**#4** - I have stopped logging updates. New content all the time. **YOLO**.

At last, I am thankful for each and every person who waited till my talk finished to share their valuable feedback, shared opportunities, and asked the right questions that made me learn more. The people who kept me soaring in high regard and also kept me close to the ground. Every bit of my Bachelor's helped me in my growth essentially. Be it personal, academic, professional. I hope this information is useful and inspiring, for people looking to contribute and expose themselves to everything that is out there and make the most of it. I for one, have always loved to do that. Read more good things about these [people in my life](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/thankyou2020/#more-2367).
