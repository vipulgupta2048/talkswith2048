Excerpt: I’ve been exploring observability means to engineering leaders. Vipul Gupta's response was a surprise. It wasn’t about observing applications, it was observing their CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions. 

At balena, Vipul’s team manages hundred of thousands IoT devices running balenaOS. That creates a unique challenge. How do you test software that runs on physical devices? How do you ensure pipelines are reliable when they depend on hardware that can be flaky?

Every code change needs to be tested on real hardware using “hardware in the loop” pipelines. 🖨️

CI/CD at this scale is fragile. Pipelines fail constantly due to dependency changes, hardware flakiness, or transient network issues. But workflows are business critical – monitoring them is a priority.
