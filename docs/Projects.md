Who knew? I love working on product design so much. It all started with this take-home assignment, I received from a PM interview. Now, I work on product design creating wireframes on AdobeXD whenever I feel like it. It feels liberating to let my ideas flow on a 770x340Px artboard with nothing but me and my prototypes.

It's an e-commerce app for buying, selling, and renting second-hand books online. I have [documented the idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ppgt6Pk2n0Mdp2YpBTtIym8Nx4ugAlAz92r067DDsEU/edit?usp=sharing) as well behind the project if you like to read. It has all the information from the logistics of how books are bought and sold to the renting model involved.
