Who knew? I love working on product design so much. It all started with this take-home assignment, I received from a PM interview. Now, I work on product design creating wireframes on AdobeXD whenever I feel like it. It feels liberating to let my ideas flow on a 770x340Px artboard with nothing but me and my prototypes.
