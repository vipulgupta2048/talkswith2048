From the start, I had the pleasure of contributing and participating in Google Summer of Code with [Sugar Labs in 2018](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc) and again a year later with [The Scrapy Project in 2019](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/mygsoc). Executing these projects and working with the organizations taught me a lot. Even after the projects have finished, I continued to volunteer with Sugar Labs focusing on Outreach efforts and playing an active part in their Google OSS programs. I contribute code frequently to ScrapingHub and The Scrapy Project. These were good times indeed.
