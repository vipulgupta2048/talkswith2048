# Docs of vipulgupta2048

Welcome to my corner of the internet!
 
I am Vipul, going by @vipulgupta2048. I am an open-source developer, documentarian, community manager and growth hacker. I enjoy backpacking solo on long trips, reviewing cheesecakes in each country I visit and collecting Calvin & Hobbes comics. This docs site is my collection of everything I ever done which makes up for a pretty good portfolio. I am not a person that appreciate rebuilding the wheel unless for personal learning. Hence, back in 2016 when I was introduced to computer science. I was hooked. I was hooked on the idea of building things. I was hooked on the idea of sharing knowledge. I was hooked on the idea of open-source which became the North Star of my career.

I strongly believe in Open Source being more than software. Itâ€™s a culture, a conversation, a way to bring the best minds together for the common good. This culture thrives on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and shared achievement. It's a realm where barriers of entry have been lowered to enable folks to grow, contribute and learn from each other. 

As a result, open-source is not just a method for developing software; it's a movement; it's a way of life. I aim to rethink that for more companies embracing [innersource](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-innersource/) and want to take on new roles in organization to do just that. You can [hire me](#hiring) to do just that.

Over the years, I have given back considerable time in enabling efforts towards a better open-source future. These docs reflect that journey. It's an odometer that keeps track of my professional journey for I think was time well spent on Earth giving back. Personal introspection aside, maintaing this collection has worked well for sudden bouts of either imposter syndrome hitting or recruiter screens when looking for a role.

### Failures of 2048

With this section, I intend to make it crystal clear that it's hasn't been an easy journey all these years. The grass wasn't greener on this side and it never gets easier. If you are someone starting to contribute to open-source, pursuing higher studies in computer science, or learning something new, you are doing just fine. I didn't reach this point without failing a thousand times first, and then getting up just to fail again. You (The Reader) my advice for you is to dig deep, don't lose hope, and give your best shot to everything from this moment on. Life's got something nice in store for you. The rat race would soon end up for you. Just keep working hard.

At last, I am thankful for each person who waited till my talk finished, or met up in a conference to share their valuable feedback, helped me in a GitHub issue, gave me a new opportunity, and asked the right questions that made me learn more. I hope this information is more useful to you in ways of exploring opportunites that already exist out there. I wrote [acknowledgements](https://mixster.dev/2020/03/19/thankyou2020/#more-2367) a while back and I should probably write more. 

### Hiring 

If you like what you see, what I do and how I do it, then [drop a quick message](mailto:vipulgupta2048@gmail.com) how I can do it even better for you. Appreciate it!
Feel to reach out for anything else as well, happy to connect and help out. 

### Credits

I always had an idea to build a docs as portfolio website since I love docs so much but the inspiration on Docusaurus showcase definitely helped. I already had [talkswith2048](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048) for the docs which paired nicely with [kosiec.dev](https://kosiec.dev/)'s clean, minimalistic welcome page. Thank you for open-sourcing that.
