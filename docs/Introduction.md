    <p>I am Vipul, going by @vipulgupta2048. I'm an open-source developer, documentarian, community manager and growth hacker. I enjoy backpacking solo on long trips, reviewing cheesecakes in each country I visit, and collecting Calvin & Hobbes comics.</p>
    <p>This docs site is my collection of everything I've ever done‚Äîmaking up for a pretty comprehensive portfolio. I'm not someone who appreciates rebuilding the wheel unless it's for personal learning.</p>
    <p>Back in 2016, when I was introduced to computer science, I was hooked. Hooked on the idea of building things. Hooked on sharing knowledge. Hooked on open-source, which became the North Star of my career.</p>

### My Open Source Philosophy

    <p>I strongly believe in Open Source being more than software. It's a culture, a conversation, a way to bring the best minds together for the common good. This culture thrives on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and shared achievement. It's a realm where barriers of entry have been lowered to enable folks to grow, contribute and learn from each other.</p>
    <p>As a result, open-source is not just a method for developing software; it's a movement; it's a way of life. I aim to rethink that for more companies embracing <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-innersource/">innersource</a> and want to take on new roles in organization who want to think about this.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have given back considerable time in enabling efforts towards a better open-source future. These docs reflect that journey. It's an odometer that keeps track of my professional journey for I think was time well spent on Earth giving back.</p>

### The Reality: Failures of 2048

    <p>With this section, I want to make it crystal clear that this hasn't been an easy journey. The grass is never greener on any side, and it never gets easier.</p>
    <p>If you're starting to contribute to open-source, pursuing higher studies in computer science, or learning something new‚Äîkeep going. You are <em>just fine</em>. This list shouldn't become a checklist.</p>
    <p>These docs don't list the hundreds of failures, rejections, or lost opportunities. My advice to you (the reader): dig deep, don't lose hope in STEM, and give your best shot to everything from this moment on.</p>
    <p>Life has something beautiful in store for you. I know the <a href="https://mixster.dev/2020/12/20/rat-race/">rat race</a> will end for you too. Keep working hard and stay in the mix of things.</p>

    <p>I always had the idea to build a docs-as-portfolio website since I love documentation so much. The inspiration from the Docusaurus showcase definitely helped. I already had <a href="https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048">talkswith2048</a> as the foundation, which paired nicely with <a href="https://kosiec.dev/">kosiec.dev</a>'s clean, minimalistic design. Thank you for open-sourcing that.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, I'm grateful to everyone who waited until my talk finished, met up at conferences to share valuable feedback, helped me with GitHub issues, gave me new opportunities, and asked the right questions that made me learn and think deeper.</p>
    <p>You know who you are. I wrote <a href="https://mixster.dev/2020/03/19/thankyou2020/#more-2367">acknowledgments</a> before and should write more about the amazing people fueling this open-source community.</p>

  <p style={{marginBottom: '0'}}>Maintaining this collection works well for sudden bouts of imposter syndrome and recruiter conversations. It's my way of documenting growth and giving back to the community that shaped me.</p>
