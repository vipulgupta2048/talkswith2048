After being an organizer for many years to a number of communities, I have thought of starting my own meetups. I take huge pride in striking that spark that is conversations between strangers, building relationships more than piling up connections and helping my people succeed. Good vibes guaranteed is what I bring to a conference/meetup. Here's what I have worked on in the past.

The community grew to 11k members but don't have the bandwidth remaining to be co-organizer again. |
