After being an organizer for many years to a number of communities, I have thought of starting my own meetups. I take huge pride in striking that spark that is conversations between strangers, building relationships more than piling up connections and helping my people succeed. Good vibes guaranteed is what I bring to a conference/meetup. Here's what I have worked on in the past.

| PyDelhi Meetup | [Meetup](https://meetup.com/pydelhi) | 2017-2020 | Actively volunteered as co-organizer for 3 years till Covid came and my social battery got depleted through Zoom meetups. During my time, we organized meetups every fortnight for 2 years straight with several collaborations, workshops, talks, devsprints and fun hackathons in the middle. The community grew to 11k members but don't have the bandwidth remaining to be co-organizer again. |

| ALiAS | [Community](https://asetalias.in) | 2016 - Present | My proudest achievement has been founding an independent, open-source college community with my peers called ALiAS. Few students in a classroom peer learning git and GitHub kickstarted this open-source culture at my alma mater that grew into hundreds of students across campuses learning to contribute to FOSS. ALiAS is now flourishing with folks self-organizing community, summer of code programs, hackathons and conferences. It's free, open for all and has no hierarchal governance model. Student volunteers run events every week with support from seniors (us) who provide mentorship, opportunities and guidance that we never received. I started the [ALiAS AMA](https://mixster.dev/2019/06/01/aliasama/) which helped 20 students get selected in GSoC over a three year period. After getting accepted in HackMIT 2018, I created an [Abroad Opportunities Fund Scholarship](https://amity.edu/admissions-scholarship.aspx) to help students get monetory support to every opportunity they want to reach out for. |
