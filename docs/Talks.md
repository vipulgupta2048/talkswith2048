From local meetups to global conferences, I've aimed to weave technical concepts into unconventional, witty narratives. I believe deeply in the impact of a good story. Through my talks, I strive to not just inform but to connect, making each concept relatable and each session memorable. I still have a lot to learn, and you can find me collecting feedback from the audience after the talk. I intend to bring my unique brand of fun into each session I propose. No repeats, no boring monologue, if I can help it - Just a good, fun story. Served on a stage near you. Next time, please pull me in for feedback that you can provide.

## Stats 

- **Years of Experience:** 8+ years since 2017
- **Total Sessions:** 100+ online/offline 
- **Audience Reach:** 100,000+ senior engineers, early-career devs, and engineering students.
