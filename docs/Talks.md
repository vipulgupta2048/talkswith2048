From local meetups to global conferences, I've aimed to weave technical concepts into unconventional, witty narratives. I believe deeply in the impact of a good story. Through my talks, I strive to not just inform but to connect, making each concept relatable and each session memorable. I still have a lot to learn, and you can find me collecting feedback from the audience after the talk. I intend to bring my unqiue brand of fun into each session I propose. No repeats, no boring monologue, if I can help it - Just a good, fun story. Served on a stage near you. Next time, please pull me in for feedback that you can provide.

I want to help revive the community we once ran in college called [ALiAS](https://asetalias.in/) and get students motivated about future prospects.

The talks was a deep dive into the last three years of my work at balena building an open-source hardware-in-the-loop pipeline that tests software directly on an IoT device in a CI/CD pipeline. The work resulted in balenaOS being released in a matter of hours rather than weeks of testing. Further blogs on the topic [1](https://blog.balena.io/from-pr-to-release-os-testing-at-balena/) [2](https://blog.balena.io/maximizing-resources-in-the-chip-shortage-how-balenaos-testing-went-virtual/) |
