| Mentoring contributors at my alma Mater | [ALiAS](https://asetalias.in) | My proudest achievement has been founding an independent, open-source college community with my peers. Few students in a classroom peer learning git and GitHub kickstarted the open-source culture at my alma mater that grew into hundreds of students across campuses learning to contribute to FOSS. The community decayed at one point but never died. It's flourishing with folks self-organizing internships, summer of code programs, hackathons and conferences. It's free, open for all and has no hierarchal governance model. Student volunteers run events every week with support from seniors (us) who provide mentorship, opportunities and guidance that we never received. I started the [ALiAS AMA](https://mixster.dev/2019/06/01/aliasama/), and [Abroad Opportunities Fund Scholarship](https://amity.edu/admissions-scholarship.aspx) to help students get access to every opportunity they want to reach out for.  |
