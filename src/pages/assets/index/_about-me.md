I am a product owner with 5+ years of experience building hard-tech IoT applications, documentation and communities in the open. I currently work for Balena and run an initiative to "right" the docs and build scalable content pipelines for startups called Mixster.

I build highly scalable, cross platform applications in Node.js/Typescript while continously learning new skills to expand my toolbox with varied experience in Python, Go, and Rust. Open-source has been a major part of my career since I began in 2017 with Google Summer of Code and Google Code-In as a mentor. I help organize organize PyCon India, mentor college students with ALiAS, and run several meetup groups in my city. 

Lately, I have been enjoying taking on new challenges consulting with startups on growth, hiring and marketing challenges intersecting with content, people and code. I bring a strong sense of ownership, with my own brand of "firestarter" energy to any collective I join. I practice first principles thinking wearing multiple hats, and driving teams to achieve results in organizations I have worked for. 

Currently, I am a product owner and documentation lead at Balena enabling folks to build, test and deploy their edge applications directly on actual hardware through a hardware in the loop CI/CD ÃŸpipeline.
