I am a product owner with 5+ years of experience building hard-tech IoT applications, documentation and communities in the open. 

I create highly scalable, reliable applications in Node.js/Typescript and deploying them on resource constrained environments. With past experience in software development, release engineering, and customer support, I have built efficient multi-arch Docker builds and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI etc. 

I bring a strong sense of ownership, with my own brand of "firestarter" energy to any collective I join. I practice first principles thinking, feel comfortable wearing multiple hats, and driving teams to achieve results in every organization I have worked for. 

Open-source has been a major part of life. For that reason, I help organize organize PyCon India, mentor college students with ALiAS, and run several meetup groups in my city. 

Currently, I am a product owner & documentation lead at Balena. I run Mixster, a initiative to "right" the docs and build scalable content pipelines for startups and organizations. I am always on the lookout for new challenges on the intersection of product, people and code.
