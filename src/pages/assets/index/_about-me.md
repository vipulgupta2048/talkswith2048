I am a product owner with 5+ years of experience building hard-tech IoT applications, documentation and communities in the open. 

I create highly scalable, reliable applications in Node.js/Typescript for resource constrained environments. Deploying them using efficient multi-arch Docker builds, and CI/CD pipelines built with Jenkins, GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI etc. My diverse experience comes from significant efforts in product development, release engineering, developer relations and customer success. 

I bring a strong sense of ownership, with my own brand of "firestarter" energy to any collective I join. I practice first principles thinking, feel comfortable wearing multiple hats, and driving teams to achieve results in every organization I have worked for. 

Open-source has been a major part of life. For that reason, I help organize PyCon India, mentor college students with ALiAS, and work with several FOSS meetup groups in my city. 

Currently, I am a product owner & documentation lead at Balena. I run Mixster, an initiative to "right" the docs and build scalable content pipelines for startups and organizations. I am always on the lookout for new challenges on the intersection of product, people and code.
