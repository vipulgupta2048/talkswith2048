I take huge pride in striking that spark that is conversations between strangers, building relationships more than piling up connections and helping my people succeed. Good vibes guaranteed is what I bring to a conference/meetup. Here\'s what I have worked on in the past.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Conferences":{"id":"Conferences","title":"Conferences","description":"From attending, to volunteering, to organizing and networking in conferences. Whatever role I play in a conference. I add it here. Conferences are strange for me in their phenomena. Apart from all the travel, meeting people, preparing to take the stage there is a genuine fear of missing out for me. If I don\'t attend one, there is FOMO. But, the more you connect in one, the more FOMO you get. Whether that\'s the case for you. Few things are certain. Social batteries are bound to run out. Leg pain is mandatory. And, If you are attending every single session then probably rethink your approach and spend some time in the hallway. See you there!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Designs":{"id":"Designs","title":"Designs","description":"Take a peek at my design attempts, where I center align inspiration, rotate prespectives to create visually appealing \\"stuff\\".","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Google Summer of Code":{"id":"Google Summer of Code","title":"Google Summer of Code","description":"From the start, I had the pleasure of contributing and participating in Google Summer of Code with Sugar Labs in 2018 and again a year later with The Scrapy Project in 2019. Executing these projects and working with the organizations taught me a lot. Even after the projects have finished, I continued to volunteer with Sugar Labs focusing on Outreach efforts and playing an active part in their Google OSS programs. I contribute code frequently to ScrapingHub and The Scrapy Project. These were good times indeed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"gsoc":{"id":"gsoc","title":"gsoc","description":""},"Hackathons":{"id":"Hackathons","title":"Hackathons","description":"| Hackathons      | Links | Comments |","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction":{"id":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to my corner of the internet!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Mentoring":{"id":"Mentoring","title":"Mentoring","description":"| Program  | Organization | Status/LoC |","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Podcasts":{"id":"Podcasts","title":"Podcasts","description":"Tune into the podcasts I\'ve been a part of, discussing everything from remote work to the intricacies of open-source culture.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Projects":{"id":"Projects","title":"Projects","description":"Who knew? I love working on product design so much. It all started with this take-home assignment, I received from a PM interview. Now, I work on product design creating wireframes on AdobeXD whenever I feel like it. It feels liberating to let my ideas flow on a 770x340Px artboard with nothing but me and my prototypes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Talks":{"id":"Talks","title":"Talks","description":"From local meetups to global conferences, I\'ve aimed to weave technical concepts into unconventional, witty narratives. I believe deeply in the impact of a good story. Through my talks, I strive to not just inform but to connect, making each concept relatable and each session memorable. I still have a lot to learn, and you can find me collecting feedback from the audience after the talk. I intend to bring my unqiue brand of fun into each session I propose. No repeats, no boring monologue, if I can help it - Just a good, fun story. Served on a stage near you. Next time, please pull me in for feedback that you can provide.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
