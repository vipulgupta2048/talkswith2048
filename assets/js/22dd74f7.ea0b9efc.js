I take huge pride in striking that spark that is conversations between strangers, building relationships more than piling up connections and helping my people succeed. Good vibes guaranteed is what I bring to a conference/meetup. Here\'s what I have worked on in the past.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Conferences":{"id":"Conferences","title":"Conferences","description":"From attending, to volunteering, to organizing and networking in conferences. Whatever role I play in a conference. I add it here. Conferences are strange for me in their phenomena. Apart from all the travel, meeting people, preparing to take the stage there is a genuine fear of missing out for me. If I don\'t attend one, there is FOMO. But, the more you connect in one, the more FOMO you get. Whether that\'s the case for you. Few things are certain. Social batteries are bound to run out. Leg pain is mandatory. And, If you are attending every single session then probably rethink your approach and spend some time in the hallway. See you there!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Designs":{"id":"Designs","title":"Designs","description":"Take a peek at my design attempts, where I center align inspiration, rotate prespectives to create visually appealing \\"stuff\\".","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Google Summer of Code":{"id":"Google Summer of Code","title":"Google Summer of Code","description":"| Project  | Project org | Proposal Links | Work Product | Status/LoC |","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Hackathons":{"id":"Hackathons","title":"Hackathons","description":"| Hackathons      | Links | Comments |","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"interview-questions":{"id":"interview-questions","title":"Questions about work","description":"What\u2019s the most impressive or the most difficult thing that you\u2019ve built?

I still have a lot to learn, and you can find me collecting feedback from the audience after the talk. I intend to bring my unique brand of fun into each session I propose.
