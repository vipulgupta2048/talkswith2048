## Updates

**#1** - From 2018, I added a new section for hackathons. I think hackathons are a great way to learn fast, implement faster, and learn from mistakes of the past. An ideology that I thoroughly believe to practice in my day-to-day.

**#2** - From 2019, added Podcasts as well :hatching_chick:

**#3** - From July'19, I am adding posters as well. Something I like dearly is creating good content, no matter how hard it might be. Meetup posters hold quite a special place in my mind as that always helps me think towards design, UI/UX as well as mixing up different techniques. These are Canva made, ain't special. I like them so why not show them.

**#4** - I have stopped logging updates. New content all the time. **YOLO**.
